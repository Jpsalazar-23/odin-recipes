    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the recipe that I make to bring together a large group of people. It;s citric, hearty, and warm. You can
        substitute any protein for chicken; popular options
        are porks, tofu, shrimp, and fish. It comes together in one pot and pairs really well with white rice.</p>
