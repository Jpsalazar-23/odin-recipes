    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The first time I had Matar Paneer was with my Indian coworkers at Nokia. I was amazed that even after years of
        eating Indian food I was able to find a new favorite curry. What always brings me back to the dish is the
        beautiful way it pairs with rice.</p>
