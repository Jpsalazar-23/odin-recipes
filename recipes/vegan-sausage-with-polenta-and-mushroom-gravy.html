    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was vegan for a few years and I made this recipe for some of my meat eating friends. They really loved it, it's savory, carbheavy and oh so delicous. 
        It will have you licking the Umami-rich sauce off of the plate.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegan Beef Grounds (tofu mince)</li>
        <li>Brown Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Vegetarian Broth</li>
        <li>Mushroom Seasoning</li>
        <li>Nutritional Yeast</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Your choice of polenta</li>
        <li>Thick Oat or Cashew Milk</li>
        <li>Vegan Butter</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>We will start this recipe by warming our butter on low heat.</li>
        <li>Once we have a nice warm base, we are going to add our mushrooms. Chop, mince, or slice as you would like.</li>
        <li>Salt, Pepper, and Saute the mushrooms for a good 15 to 20 minutes, allow them to sear and brown. This will help release all of our juices.</li>
        <li>Add butter to the pan as it reduces, once we have a nice brown butter sauce, add garlic and saute until browned.</li>
        <li>At this point sear your vegan beef grounds and allow them to cook in this sauce base. </li>
        <li>Once the grounds have cooked, we will add our vegetarian broth as well as our dry seasonings 
            (Garlic, Onion, Mushroom, and Nutritional Yeast) and simmer until the sauce reduces. </li>
        <li>Begin to pour your creamy thickener (oat or cashew milk), simmer this until the mix comes together and you achieve the desired thickness.
             Salt and pepper to your liking. </li>
        <li>Warm oil in a separate pan, slice and sear the polenta until crispy. 
            Alternatively, you can make a creamy polenta by using the ground variety and adding to hot water.</li>
        <li>To plate, lay down the polenta, pour the mushroom gravy on top of the polenta. You can sprinkle vegan parmesan on top and some pepper. Enjoy!</li>
